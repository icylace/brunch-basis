Styles are written in a verbose fashion for ease of maintainability.
Preprocessing will take care of producing production-ready CSS.

Stylus is used for styles development.

Rules are ordered according to criteria of subsequently increasing priority:

  1.  Collect into groups ordered in the following way:
      1.  Elements
      2.  Pseudo-Selectors
      3.  Classes
      4.  IDs
      5.  Hacks
      6.  Development-Oriented (e.g. diagnostic styles)

  2.  Within each group order rules according to the following:
      1.  Nesting order if there is one (e.g. '.main-wrapper' before '.main').
      2.  Rules with multiple selectors are grouped together by similar
          starting selectors.
      3.  Increasing cascade level.
      4.  Increasing specificity.
      5.  Classes and IDs are ordered by sibling order if there is one
          (e.g. '.main-header' before '.main-footer').
      6.  HTML document order.
      7.  Finally, alphabetical order.

Rules with a single property may be written on a single line.  Rules that are
in a contiguous series with similar properties may each be written on a single
line.  Contiguous single-line rules should have their opening and closing
braces line up together.

Selectors are arranged similarly to rules.

Properties are ordered alphabetically.

Hex notation is used for opaque color values.

Shorthand notation is used when it serves readability.

Percentages are used when defining font-size.

In HTML elements, attributes related to CSS are arranged in order of increasing
CSS specificity (i.e. first "class" then "id" then "style").
