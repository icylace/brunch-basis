/**
 * Styles are written in a verbose fashion for ease of maintainability.
 * Preprocessing will take care of producing production-ready CSS.
 *
 * Stylus is used for styles development.
 *
 * Rules are ordered according to criteria of subsequently increasing priority:
 *
 *     1.  Collect into groups ordered in the following way:
 *         1.  Elements
 *         2.  Pseudo-Selectors
 *         3.  Classes
 *         4.  IDs
 *         5.  Hacks
 *         6.  Development-Oriented (e.g. diagnostic styles)
 *
 *     2.  Within the elements group order rules according to the order they
 *         are listed in section 4 of the HTML Living Standard
 *         (http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#auto-toc-4).
 *
 *     3.  Within each group order rules according to the following:
 *         1.  Nesting order if there is one
 *             (e.g. '.main-wrapper' before '.main').
 *         2.  Rules with multiple selectors are grouped together by similar
 *             starting selectors.
 *         3.  Increasing cascade level.
 *         4.  Increasing specificity.
 *         5.  Classes and IDs are ordered by sibling order if there is one
 *             (e.g. '.main-header' before '.main-footer').
 *         6.  Finally, alphabetical order.
 *
 * The layout of the markup may inform the final arrangement of the rules.
 *
 * Rules with a single property may be written on a single line.  Rules that
 * are in a contiguous series with similar properties may each be written on a
 * single line.  Contiguous single-line rules should have their opening and
 * closing braces line up together.
 *
 * Selectors are arranged similarly to rules and are generally listed one per
 * line.
 *
 * Properties are ordered alphabetically.
 *
 * Hex notation is used for opaque color values for sake of consistency.
 *
 * Shorthand notation is used when it serves readability.
 *
 *
 * Percentages are used when defining font-size.

 *
 * Some default values borrowed from YUI 3 Base.
 * http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/cssbase
 *
 * Some typography defaults borrowed from Azbuka.
 * http://www.vcarrer.com/2009/11/azbuka-css-typographical-base-rendering.html
 *
 * In HTML elements, attributes related to CSS are arranged in order of
 * increasing CSS specificity (i.e. first "class" then "id" then "style").
